//Description: This file holds step 1 and 2 for the Lab 1 Assignment.
//Step 1 runs various network commands in Linux and this file holds the observations for each of these commands.
//Step 2 is to test 3 hosts on the internet and ping each host with different packet sizes. This file holds the 
//packet loss present for each host and the RTT (round trip time).

Step 1 :
a:netstat
	helpful to look at your networks configurations as well as activity 
	netstat -a shows the sockets that are active and/or waiting for connection
	netstat -r displays the kernel ip routing table 


b:ifconfig
	this command configures other displays network interface parameters, using TCP/IP
	displays information of all interfaces in my system
	when attaching -a to the command it is in place of an interface name


c:hostname
	displays the hostname of my Mac system 
	this is the result when I enter in my command line: Lydias-MacBook-Pro-3.local
	
	man hostname is the manual shows the options -f , -s , -d 


d:ping
	this TCP/IP command sends an echo_request to network hosts
	it helps you look at the connectivity and name solution and reachability
	
	man ping shows the ping manual with the options  -A, -a, -b, -c, -C, -D, -d ,-f


e:traceroute
	this command prints the route packets trace to the network host, using ICMP (internet control
	message protocol) packets
	these icmp packets hold information about the routers abilities to transport data


f:telnet
	this command is used if you need to get on a remote server at typically the http port 80 
	telnet transfers the data in simple text, where as ssh is encrypted and uses a secure channel


g:host/dig
	Host: host is typically used to convert ip addresses to names and names to ip adresses, host is also 
	a dns lookup utility, it prints a short summary of its options and command line arguments 

	Dig : domain information groper, it is also a dns lookup utility, dig is used to perform dns lookups 
	and to troubleshoot dns problems



h:route
	route is used to manually manipulate routing tables, it has six commands: add, flush, delete, change,
	get, and monitor

	it allows the user to specify an arbitrary request


i:arp
	this command addresses resolution display and control, it displays and modifies the internet to ethernets 	address translation tables used by arp4.




Step 2:

North America: https://www.youtube.com

	packet loss: 0% packet loss

	RTT "round trip time": 56.341


Asia: https://www.coupang.com

	packet loss: 0% packet loss

	RTT "round trip time": 116.022


Europe: https://harrods.com

	packet loss: 0% packet loss

	RTT "round trip time": 156.343
